# mvRunKing
## Downloading mvRunKing

mvRunKing can be downloaded from https://github.com/RunKingProgram/mvRunKing.

## mvRunKing dependencies

mvRunKing runs on Linux, MAC OSX and Windows (Windows Subsystem for Linux). The runtime has the following dependencies:

C++ tool chain >= 5.5.0, GNU Science library (GSL) 2.x and zlib.

## Input Files
mvRunKing requires three main input files : genotype file, phenotype file and genomic relationship matrix (GRM) file.<br>

#### Genotype file
Genotype file consists of three PLINK BED files with the same name. For example, Genotype.bed, Genotype.bim and Genotype.fam.

#### Phenotype file
Phenotype file is a n × d matrix, which contains multiple justified phenotypes for some fixed factors including population means, stratification, sex and age so on as multiple column. <br>
|phenotype 1| phenotype 2| phenotype 3|...|phenotype d|
| ---------- | :-----------:  | :-----------: | :-----------:| :-----------:|
|1 |4.9| 1.1|...|2.3|
|1.1 |4.6| 2.2|...|2.4|
|1.2 |8| 3.8|...|2.2|
|2.1 |10.1| 1.3|...|3.2|
|3.1 |14.9| 1.4|...|3.2|
|3.1 |16.2| 2.7|...|2.3|
|3.2 |15.2| 3.6|...|2.3|
|3 |14.3| 4.5|...|4.2|
...
#### GRM file
GRM file is a n × n matrix, where each row and each column corresponds to individuals in the same order as in the .fam file, and *i*th row and *j*th column is a number indicating the relatedness value between *i*th and *j*th individuals. <br>

## Running mvRunKing

mvRunKing is a command-line program. Open up a command prompt or terminal window and perform all analyses by typing commands. Software usage is very similar to GEMMA software. 

The basic usages for association analysis are:
```
./mvRunKing -bfile [plinkfile] -p [phenofile] -k [kinshipfile] -SeparatemvRunKing -n [num1] [num2]...[numd] -o [outputfilename]

./mvRunKing -bfile [plinkfile] -p [phenofile] -k [kinshipfile] -JiontmvRunKing -n [num1] [num2]...[numd]  -o [outputfilename]

```
Where the “-SeparatemvRunKing” performs a test at once; “-JiontmvRunKing” performs Joint association analysis; “-bfile [plinkfile]” specifies PLINK BED files prefix; “-p [filename]” specifies phenotype file name; “-k [kinshipfile]” specifies relatedness matrix file name and “-o [outputfilename]” specifies output file prefix. You can specify different columns of phenotypes for association tests by using “-n [num1] [num2]...[numd]”, where “-n 1 2 ” uses the original 1st and 2nd columns as phenotypes, and “-n 2 3 5” uses the 2nd, 3rd and 5th columns, and so on.
